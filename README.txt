This school project aims to help me with calculations in geometric algebra for quadratic surfaces (personal use). It is an extension of the conformal geometric algebra (CGA) and geometric algebra for conics (GAC) projects.
The aim is to manipulate multivectors in possibly intuitive way, not to be quick since with 2^15 dimensions it gets messy. 
What to be aware of:
-QCGA object having scalar part has to be of the form \scalar*one + (rest of the multivector)\ since "one" is an object representing 1 as an algebra's identity.
-The ordering of operators is sometimes wild so when something doesn't work you may have not enough parentheses
